What is it:
===========
These files add support for the UCM framework via tinyhal for the targeted Linaro development boards. Tinyhal is a replacement Android HAL for audio. For more information, refer to the project page at: http://opensource.wolfsonmicro.com/content/tinyhal


To build:
=========
These instructions are for integration into the Linaro Android builds. Refer to the Linaro Android page for more information:

http://wiki.linaro.org/Platform/Android

Copy these files to the build tree locations listed, taking care not to overwrite the originals, if you wish to save them.

1) Copy BoardConfig.mk to:
device/linaro/pandaboard

2) Copy Android.mk and audio_hw.c to:
device/linaro/pandaboard/audio


Now, after successfully building and using linaro-android-media-create to install the Android images onto your SD card, do these steps:

1) On the SD card, if it doesn't already exist, make the directory:
system/etc/sound 

2) Copy pandaboard.xml to the directory you just created on the SD card:
system/etc/sound
